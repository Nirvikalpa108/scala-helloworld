# Playful beginner Scala scripts

These scala scripts are my first forays into Scala, coming from the Ruby programming language. 
All scripts are written using TDD. Expect lots of fun, mistakes and experimentation!

## Getting started with Scala

It's easy to get started with Scala, follow the below steps and if you get stuck just send me a [message](https://twitter.com/a_adewusi).
* Let's install Java. In our console, run `java`. If this runs, you already have java installed, if not, you will be prompted to install Java and you can follow the steps.
* We can install SBT, an open source tool, which compiles our Scala code and manages our dependencies amongst other things. If you have Homebrew, you can run `brew install sbt`.
If not, you can find instructions [here](https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html).
* Install a text editor, we use IntelliJ IDEA, the Community version, which you can install [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download).

## Run this project
